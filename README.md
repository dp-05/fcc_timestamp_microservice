# API Project: Timestamp Microservice

Description: 

This is an API that provides a timestamp in a JSON response in UNIX and UTC formats. 
  
If left blank, the response is a simple date() object. If invalid (cannot be parsed in date() object), the response returns an error message.

Example: 
	> request: <url>/api/timestamp/2005-12-15; 
	> response: {"unix":1135468800000,"utc":"Sun, 25 Dec 2005 00:00:00 GMT"}
  
  
  > request: <url>/api/timestamp/thisisn'tcorrect
  > JSON response: {"unix": null, "utc" : "Invalid Date"}
